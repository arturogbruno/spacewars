### Play the game 👉🏻 https://arturogbruno.github.io/spacewars/

### Intro

Space Wars is a tribute to the famous Space Invaders arcade game. It's the first project I made for Ironhack's web development bootcamp.

The game is built using canvas technology from HTML5 and JavaScript.

### About the game 👾

You are commanding the spaceship and your mission is to prevent the aliens invade the Earth, so you have to destroy them.

Use arrow keys to move your spaceship and space bar to shoot your laser weapon.

### Thanks 👏🏻

A big thanks to my teammates and teachers for their support.
